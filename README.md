A shooting gallery style game for learning regex. Will constantly be adding levels, so be sure to check in every now and again.

An old school project that I later refactored to use React. It is a simple movie catalog, compiled using movie data from 2001-2004.

## Flickr Geo Collage
[link to repo](https://github.com/kemptosa/flickr-geo-collage) | [link to site](https://rvo.lv/flickr-geo-collage)
This site takes location data from the browser (or just some default data for those privacy-minded individuals who instinctually hit deny on the location access request pop-up) to get a live collection of photos uploaded within the users geographical area.

## ~~Newgrounds Scraper~~ (IN PROGRESS/SECRET)

Uses perceptual image hashing to consolidate multiple social media feeds into one place.
